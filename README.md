# Few things to Consider before using this program:

## 1. The actual program must be in directory: 
    `/Users/biplovegautam/CodeEverything/work/deepseek`

## 2.  Things to install:
  a. ollama
     run `ollama run deepseek-r1:1.5b`

  b. streamlit
      This will automatically be installed on the background once the app is initialized
      This might take a while on the first launch but is one time setup
